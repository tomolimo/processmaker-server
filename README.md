|* Overview *|
--------------
ProcessMaker is an open source, workflow management software suite, which 
includes tools to automate your workflow, design forms, create documents, assign
roles and users, create routing rules, and map an individual process quickly and
easily. It's relatively lightweight and doesn't require any kind of installation
on the client computer. This file describes the requirements and installation 
steps for the server.

|* Requirements for Server *|
-----------------------------
ProcessMaker 2.0 and later requires:

* Linux or UNIX or Windows (XP, Vista, 7, Server 2003, Server 2008)  

* MySQL 5.1.6 or greater

* Apache 2.2.3 or greater, with the following modules:
  * Deflate
  * Expires
  * Rewrite
  * Vhost_alias
 
* PHP 5.1.6 or greater with the following libraries:
  * mysql
  * xml
  * mbstring
  * mcrypt
  * soap (necessary if using web services)
  * ldap (necessary if integrating with LDAP or Active Directory)
  * gd   (recommended if using Events)
  * curl (necessary for uploading/downloading files) 

  * Also install PHP's command line interface (CLI) if planning on using Events, 
    the Case Scheduler, workspace backup/restore, or developing plugins with the 
    Gulliver Framework. 

------------------------------
|* Requirements for Clients *|
------------------------------
Mozilla FireFox (recommended) 
  or 
Internet Explorer 7 or later     

-----------------------
|* PHP Configuration *|
-----------------------
In the PHP configuration file (php.ini), set the following settings:
  memory_limit = 120M
  file_uploads = On
  short_open_tag = On 
The memory_limit may be a minimum of 80MB, but it is recommended to set it to 
120MB. If planning on uploading large Input Documents and attached files, then 
increase the max_post_size and upload_max_filesize to larger than the default 
2MB:
  max_post_size = 2M 
  upload_max_filesize = 2M

After editing the "php.ini" file, restart the Apache server for the new 
configuration to take effect.

-------------------------
|* MySQL Configuration *|
-------------------------
The MySQL "root" user should already have all the necessary privileges to setup
the ProcessMaker databases. If planning on using a MySQL user other than "root"
to set up the ProcessMaker databases, grant a MySQL user superuser privileges 
to create and update databases.

Login to MySQL:
  mysql -u root -p 
Enter the root password for MySQL.

Once in MySQL, give the user which will be running ProcessMaker superuser 
privileges to create create and modify MySQL databases:
mysql> grant all on *.* to 'USER'@'localhost' identified by 'PASSWORD' with grant option;

Replace USER with the name of your MySQL user and PASSWORD with the password 
for that user. (If that user doesn't already exist, he/she will be 
automatically created with the above grant command. If you are running 
ProcessMaker on a different server than your MySQL server, then replace 
localhost with the domain name or IP address of the server where ProcessMaker 
is located.

Exit MySQL:
mysql> exit;

If you have forgotten the root password, see these instructions to reset it:
 http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/resetting-permissions.html

If unable to log into MySQL because there is no socket, then MySQL needs to be
started as a service.

-------------------------------
|* ProcessMaker Installation *|
-------------------------------
1. Go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/processmaker/files and download a 
recent tarball of ProcessMaker, which should be named "processmaker-2.X-X.tar.gz"

The versions are numbered according to the pattern MAJOR.MINOR-REVISION, such 
as "2.0-8". Beta versions will have the word "beta" appended to the version 
number.

2. Move the "processmaker-X.X-X.tar.gz" file which was downloaded to the 
directory in your server where the ProcessMaker application will be stored.

ProcessMaker can be installed in any directory which is not publicly 
accessible to the internet (so do NOT install it in "/var/www" in Linux/UNIX).  

In Linux/UNIX, it is generally installed in the "/opt" directory, since it is an 
optional program which doesn't come from the standard repositories. 

In Windows XP and Server 2003, it is generally installed in the 
"C:\Program Files" directory.

In Windows Vista, 7, and Server 2008, it is generally installed in the local
directory of a user, such as "C:/Users/X/processmaker", due to the new security 
restrictions which do not allow Apache to write to the C:/Program Files 
directory.
 
3. The code files are in .tar.gz format and can be extracted using most 
compression tools, like the "tar" command in Linux/UNIX or WinRAR or 7-Zip in 
Windows.

 Linux/UNIX:
   tar -xvzf processmaker-X.X-X.tar.gz /opt/

 MS Windows:
   Use WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract the file processmaker-X.X-X.tar.gz

This will create a new "processmaker" directory, containing all the ProcessMaker 
files and directories, which should have the following contents:

 gulliver     processmaker      rbac        shared
 LICENSE.txt  processmaker.bat  README.txt  workflow


4. Then, make the following subdirectories writable to the user running Apache:
 
 Linux/UNIX:
   Issue the following commands:
     chmod 770 /opt/processmaker/shared
     cd /opt/processmaker/workflow/engine/
     chmod 770 config content/languages plugins xmlform js/labels
   
   Then change the owner of the ProcessMaker files to Apache:
     chown -R apache-user:apache-user /opt/processmaker
   
   Replace "apache-user", with the user running Apache in your distribution.
     In RedHat/CentOS/Fedora: 
       chown -R apache:apache /opt/processmaker 
     In Debian/Ubuntu:
       chown -R www-data:www-data /opt/processmaker
     In SUSE/OpenSUSE: 
       chown -R chown wwwrun:www -R /opt/processmaker

 MS Windows:
   Make the following subdirectories writable:
     <INSTALL-DIRECTORY>\processmaker\shared
     <INSTALL-DIRECTORY>\processmaker\workflow\engine\config 
     <INSTALL-DIRECTORY>\processmaker\workflow\engine\content\languages 
     <INSTALL-DIRECTORY>\processmaker\workflow\engine\plugins 
     <INSTALL-DIRECTORY>\processmaker\workflow\engine\xmlform 
     <INSTALL-DIRECTORY>\processmaker\workflow\engine\js\labels
     
--------------------------
|* Apache Configuration *|
--------------------------
1. Edit the file "<INSTALL-DIRECTORY>/processmaker/etc/pmos.conf" with a plain
text editor (such as Notepad or Notepad++ in Windows or vim, nano or gedit in 
Linux/UNIX).

Modify the following virtual host definition to match your environment:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Please change the IP address with your server's IP address and
  # the ServerName with you own subdomain for ProcessMaker.
  NameVirtualHost your_ip_address
  #processmaker virtual host
  <VirtualHost your_ip_address >
    ServerName "your_processmaker_domain"
    DocumentRoot /opt/processmaker/workflow/public_html
    DirectoryIndex index.html index.php
    <Directory  "/opt/processmaker/workflow/public_html">
       AddDefaultCharset UTF-8
       AllowOverRide none
       Options FollowSymlinks
       Order allow,deny
       Allow from all
       RewriteEngine on
       RewriteRule ^.*/(.*)$ sysGeneric.php [NC,L]
       ExpiresActive On
       ExpiresDefault "access plus 1 day"
       ExpiresByType image/gif "access plus 1 day"
       ExpiresByType image/png "access plus 1 day"
       ExpiresByType image/jpg "access plus 1 day"
       ExpiresByType text/css "access plus 1 day"
       ExpiresByType text/javascript "access plus 1 day"
       AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html
    </Directory>
  </VirtualHost>
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Replace "your_ip_address" with the IP number or domain name of the server 
running ProcessMaker. If only planning on running and accessing ProcessMaker on
your local machine, then use the IP address "127.0.0.1". If using ProcessMaker 
on a machine whose IP address might change (such as a machine whose IP address 
is assigned with DHCP), then use "*", which represents any IP address. If not 
using the standard port 80, then it is necessary to also specify the port 
number.

If your DNS or "hosts" file has a defined domain for ProcessMaker, then use 
that domain for "your_processmaker_domain". Otherwise, use the same IP address 
for "your_processmaker_domain" as was used for "your_ip_address".

If ProcessMaker is installed in a location other than "/opt/processmaker", then
edit the paths to match where Processmaker is installed on your system.

For example, if running ProcessMaker on a Windows XP server at address 
192.168.1.100 on port 8080 with a domain at processmaker.mycompany.com:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NameVirtualHost 192.168.1.100:8080
  #processmaker virtual host
  <VirtualHost 192.168.1.100:8080 >
    ServerName "processmaker.mycompany.com"
    DocumentRoot C:\Program Files\processmaker\workflow\public_html
    DirectoryIndex index.html index.php
    <Directory  "C:\Program Files\processmaker\workflow\public_html">
    ...
------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, if running ProcessMaker on a Linux server at address 
server1.example.com with a domain at pm.example.com:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NameVirtualHost server1.example.com
  #processmaker virtual host
  <VirtualHost server1.example.com >
    ServerName "pm.example.com"
    DocumentRoot /opt/processmaker/workflow/public_html
    DirectoryIndex index.html index.php
    <Directory  "/opt/processmaker/workflow/public_html">
    ...
------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, if ProcessMaker is installed in the "/home/fred" directory on your
local machine at port 8080 with an dynamic IP assigned by DHCP:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NameVirtualHost *:8080
  #processmaker virtual host
  <VirtualHost *:8080 >
    ServerName "*"
    DocumentRoot /home/fred/processmaker/workflow/public_html
    DirectoryIndex index.html index.php
    <Directory  "/home/fred/processmaker/workflow/public_html">
    ...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: It is also possible to define the virtual host for ProcessMaker directly 
in the Apache configuration by inserting the above VirtualHost definition in 
the Apache configuration file, which is generally named "httpd.conf".

Then, copy the "pmos.conf" file to the following directory, where it will 
automatically be loaded by the Apache web server:

    Generic Linux/UNIX: 
       /etc/httpd/conf.d/pmos.conf
 
    Debian/Ubuntu: 
       /etc/apache2/sites-available/
 
       Then issue the command to enable the site: 
          a2ensite pmos.conf
 
    WINDOWS: 
       C:\wamp\bin\apache\apache2.2.8\conf\extra\pmos.conf 

If using Windows, add the following line to the "httpd.conf" file, so that the 
ProcessMaker virtual configuration can proceed:

  Include "C:\wamp\bin\apache\apache2.2.8\conf\extra\pmos.conf"


Note: If Apache is using the default port 80, then configure Skype and other 
programs to not use port 80. You can check whether a program is currently 
listening on port 80 with netstat -anb in Windows or netstat -tanp in 
Linux/UNIX.

5. Finally restart the Apache service (or reboot) to make the new ProcessMaker 
site available


--------------------------------
|* ProcessMaker Configuration *|
--------------------------------
1. Open your web browser and direct it to the IP address (and port) or domain 
name where ProcessMaker is installed:
 http://IP-ADDRESS

For example, if installed on the local machine at port 8080, then use: 
 http://localhost:8080 
   
The web browser should be redirected to the address:
 http://IP-ADDRESS/sys/en/classic/login

2. The installation configuration page should appear to setup ProcessMaker. 
(If the default Apache page appears, then disable it and restart Apache.)

In the configuration page, enter in the username and password to access MySQL. 
Click on the '''Test''' button to verify that ProcessMaker is configured 
properly. Green checkmarks will indicate that the settings work correctly.

To change a setting after clicking "Test", click on "Reset". To change the 
default administrator username and password, select the option in the 
"ProcessMaker Configuration" section. Once all the settings are properly 
configured click on "Install" to install processmaker. The installation screen 
should indicate "SUCCESS".

Click on "Finish Installation", to redirect to the ProcessMaker login screen. If
an error arises, feel free to ask in the ProcessMaker forum at: 
 http://forum.processmaker.com

At the login screen, enter the Username of "admin" and the Password of "admin" 
and the Workspace name, which by default is "workflow". 

Once logged in as the administrator, new users and processes can be created 
inside ProcessMaker. To login with a different workspace, language or skin, see: 
 http://wiki.processmaker.com/index.php/Login 

If the ProcessMaker configuration screen appears the next time you try to login, 
press CTRL+F5 to clear your web browser's cache.
 
Note: It is a good idea to reset the administrator's password to something 
more secure in the future before using ProcessMaker in production.
